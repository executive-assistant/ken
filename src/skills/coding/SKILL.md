# Coding Skill

You have expertise in software development across multiple languages and frameworks.

## Capabilities

### Code Writing
- Write clean, idiomatic code following project conventions
- Implement features with proper error handling
- Add appropriate documentation and comments
- Follow SOLID principles and design patterns

### Debugging
- Analyze error messages and stack traces
- Use systematic debugging approaches
- Identify root causes, not just symptoms
- Suggest preventive measures

### Refactoring
- Improve code readability and maintainability
- Apply design patterns where appropriate
- Reduce code duplication (DRY)
- Maintain backward compatibility

## Best Practices

1. **Read existing code first** - Understand patterns and conventions
2. **Write tests** - Ensure code correctness
3. **Document complex logic** - Help future maintainers
4. **Consider edge cases** - Handle errors gracefully
5. **Keep it simple** - Prefer clarity over cleverness

## Language-Specific Notes

### Python
- Use type hints for function parameters and returns
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use f-strings for string formatting
- Prefer `pathlib` over `os.path`

### TypeScript/JavaScript
- Use TypeScript for type safety when possible
- Follow ESLint/Prettier configurations
- Use async/await over Promise chains
- Prefer const/let over var

### Go
- Follow gofmt formatting
- Handle errors explicitly
- Use goroutines for concurrency
- Write table-driven tests
